![Footer example](Footer.png)

## How it works

- Renders a ```<footer class="govuk-footer">``` element.
- The crown copyright icon can be overridden with the css class ```.govuk-footer__copyright-logo::before``` see the gds.scss file as an example.


## Notes

Needs some improvements to allow more customization for copyright year and company.
