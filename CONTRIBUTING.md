## Submitting Contributions

We welcome contributions in the form of code, documentation, and suggestions. Please make sure to follow the guidelines outlined below.

## Development Information

To get started with development, refer to the [`DEVELOPING.md`](https://github.com/Dorset-Council-UK/GdsBlazorComponents/blob/main/DEVELOPING.md) file included in this repository. You can find it in the root of the project.

## Contributor License Agreement

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Dorset-Council-UK/GdsBlazorComponents/LICENCE).

## Project Proposals

If you wish to propose a significant change or new functionality you must submit a proposal. Please see the instructions under governance in the Wiki.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before working on a pull request, create an issue explaining what you want to contribute. This ensures that your pull request won't go unnoticed, and that you are not contributing something that is not suitable for the project. The pull request description should reference the original issue.

Your pull request must:

- Pass any tests run automatically by the Continuous Integration system
- Address a single issue or add a single item of functionality
- Contain a clean history of small, incremental, logically separate commits
- Use clear commit messages
- Be possible to merge automatically

Pull requests should merge into the `main` branch.

### Address a single issue or add a single item of functionality

Please submit separate pull requests for separate issues. This allows each to be reviewed on its own merits.

### Contain a clean commit history
The commit history explains to the reviewer the series of modifications to the code that you have made and breaks the overall contribution into a series of easily-understandable chunks. Try not to submit commits that change thousands of lines or that contain more than one distinct logical change.

### Use clear commit messages

Please follow these best practices for commit messages:
- Begin with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add," "Fix," "Update").
- Keep the message concise and avoid trailing punctuation.
- Use separate commits for logically distinct changes.

Examples: 
`Add date component`
`Fix null reference error in report handler`

### Be possible to merge automatically
Occasionally other changes to main might mean that your pull request cannot be merged automatically. In this case you may need to rebase your branch on a more recent main, resolve any conflicts, and git push --force to update your branch so that it can be merged automatically.
